    <h2> Body mass index </h2>
    <h3> What is BMI? </h3>
    <p>
      Body mass index (BMI) is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of a person.
      Body mass index is also the measure of body composition. 
      The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, 
      and is universally expressed in units of kg/m^2, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres.
    </p>
    <p>
      The BMI may be determined using a table or chart which displays BMI
      as a function of mass and height using contour lines or colours for
      different BMI categories, and which may use other units of
      measurement (converted to metric units for the calculation).
    </p>
    <p>
      The BMI is a convenient rule of thumb used to broadly categorize a
      person as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on
      tissue mass (muscle, fat, and bone) and height. That categorization
      is the subject of some debate about where on the BMI scale the
      dividing lines between categories should be placed. Commonly
      accepted BMI ranges are underweight (under 18.5 kg/m^2), normal
      weight (18.5 to 25), overweight (25 to 30), and obese (over 30).
